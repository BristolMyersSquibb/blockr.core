\title{Random IDs}
\usage{
rand_names(
  old_names = character(0L),
  n = 1L,
  ...,
  max_len = 8L,
  max_tries = 100L
)
}
\arguments{
\item{old_names}{Disallowed IDs}

\item{n}{Number of IDs to generate}

\item{..., max_len}{Passed to \code{\link[ids:adjective_animal]{ids::adjective_animal()}}}

\item{max_tries}{Max number of attempts to create IDs that do not intersect
with \code{old_names}}
}
\value{
A character vector of length \code{n} where each entry contains \code{length}
characters (all among \code{chars} and start/end with \code{prefix}/\code{suffix}), is
guaranteed to be unique and not present among values passed as \code{old_names}.
}
\description{
Randomly generated unique IDs are used throughout the package, created by
\code{rand_names()}. If random strings are required that may not clash with a set
of existing values, this can be guaranteed by passing them as \code{old_names}.
The set of allowed characters can be controlled via \code{chars} and non-random
pre- and suffixes may be specified as \code{prefix}/\code{suffix} arguments, while
uniqueness is guaranteed including pre- and suffixes.

rand_names()
rand_names(max_len = Inf)
