\usage{
new_board(
  blocks = list(),
  links = list(),
  stacks = list(),
  options = new_board_options(),
  ...,
  class = character()
)

validate_board(x)

is_board(x)
}
\arguments{
\item{blocks}{Set of blocks}

\item{links}{Set of links}

\item{stacks}{Set of stacks}

\item{options}{Board-level user settings}

\item{...}{Further (metadata) attributes}

\item{class}{Board sub-class}

\item{x}{Board object}
}
\value{
The board constructor \code{new_board()} returns a \code{board} object, as does
the validator \code{validate_board()}, which typically is called for side effects
in the form of errors. Inheritance checking as \code{is_board()} returns a scalar
logical.
}
\description{
A set of blocks, optionally connected via links and grouped into stacks
are organized as a \code{board} object. Boards are constructed using \code{new_board()}
and inheritance can be tested with \code{is_board()}, while validation is
available as (generic function) \code{validate_board()}. This central data
structure can be extended by adding further attributes and sub-classes. S3
dispatch is used in many places to control how the UI looks and feels and
using this extension mechanism, UI aspects can be customized to user
requirements. Several \href{board_blocks()}{utilities} are available for
retrieving and modifying block attributes.
