# CI hardening for the chromote-driven shinytest2 e2e tests.

# Give Chrome longer to open its remote-debugging port. chromote's default is
# 10s (`getOption("chromote.timeout", 10)` in launch_chrome_impl), too short on
# loaded CI runners -- Windows especially -- where launch intermittently aborts
# with "Chrome debugging port not open after 10 seconds". Scoped to the suite
# so the option is restored when testing finishes.

# Chrome leaves scratch dirs (com.google.Chrome.* / org.chromium.Chromium.*,
# scoped_dir variants included) wherever `$TMPDIR` pointed when it was spawned,
# and R CMD check flags leftovers in the temp directory it hands to subprocesses
# as "detritus in the temp directory" -- a NOTE the CI gate fails on. Sweeping
# those dirs at the end of the suite races a Chrome helper (crashpad, zygote)
# dropping a fresh one afterwards.
#
# Keep them out of the inspected directory instead. Chrome reads `TMPDIR` at
# spawn while R fixes `tempdir()` at startup, so pointing it at a suite-owned
# directory below the session temp dir puts the scratch one level down from
# what check lists -- it looks at that top level only, and skips the `Rtmp*`
# directory holding this one.
