# blockr.core 0.1.2

* The `blocks$mod` slot in `update(...)` payloads now expects a **delta**
  shape: a named list keyed by block ID, where each entry is a named list
  of argument values to apply to the live block. Keys must be in
  `block_external_ctrl_vars(blk)` — non-ctrl-able changes go through
  `rm` + `add`. Ctrl-arg writes hit the corresponding `reactiveVal` in
  place; `block_name` (always treated as ctrl-able) updates the block's
  registry attribute (#175).
* `block_external_ctrl_vars()` always includes `"block_name"` — every
  block can be renamed through `update(...)` regardless of its
  `external_ctrl` opt-in. `block_supports_external_ctrl()` now reports
  whether the block opts into any *user-rendered* ctrl variables (i.e.
  excluding `block_name`), preserving the gate on the ctrl plugin UI.
* The default `block_server.block` now constructs a `block_name`
  `reactiveVal` per block and appends it to the `vars` list passed to the
  ctrl plugin. Two guarded observers keep that `reactiveVal` in sync with
  the block's `block_name` attribute on the board (one emits an
  `update(mod = ...)` when the ctrl plugin writes the rv; the other
  pulls registry-attr changes back into the rv). The `ctrl_block_server`
  plugin signature is unchanged — block authors and custom ctrl plugins
  see uniform `vars` reactiveVals.
* A blockr option `attach_default_packages` can be set to opt into evaluating
  block expressions with objects from default packages directly available.
* Add `ctrl_block()` plugin for external block control, allowing blocks to be
  driven programmatically from outside the standard block UI.
* Add `clear_board()` for removing all blocks/stacks from a board.
* Add `bbquote()` and helpers (`.`, `..`) for cleaner code generation via
  `bquote()`-based quasiquotation.
* Export `custom_plugins()` and `custom_options()` for easier board
  customization.
* Add `block_metadata()` for retrieving per-block metadata and attach block
  metadata with defaults to block objects.
* Export test utilities (`blockr_test_exports()`, `new_mock_session()`,
  `export_safely()`) for use in downstream package tests.

# blockr.core 0.1.1

* Add Block-level notifications via (optional) `expr` server return value
  component `cond`.
* Export `get_board_option_value()` to make available current option settings
  via `session$UserData`.
* Introduce (optional) dependency on [thematic](
  https://rstudio.github.io/thematic/) to auto-style plots.
* Export `toolbar_ui()` which takes case of the "core" toolbar UI component.
* Utility functions `chr_ply()` and related, as well as miscellaneous utilities
  such as `set_names()`, `coal()`, etc. are now exported for use in dependent
  packages.
* Export `export_code()` to make it easier for third-party `generate_code()`
  plugin implementations.
* Use `evaluate::evaluate()` to capture plots.
* Add `new_fixed_block()` for applying a fixed (i.e. non-paramtetrized)
  transformation to data input.
* Board server callbacks are invoked with an additional argument `session`.
* Export assertion utilities such as `is_string()`, `is_count()`, etc.
* Improved ser/des, which now includes package/constructor information for all
  board, blocks, stacks and options. The corresponding infra
* Board options now contain UI/server components to provide more options for
  customization. Also blocks can require certain options to be available.
* Introduces `block_render_trigger()` to control per block class when to
  re-render the block output.
* Rework of block notifications to provide a `reactiveValues()` object
  containing notification types a separate components.
* Auto-ID generation can now be customized with a default provided by the ids
  package (if available).
* Use the glue package for logging/block notifications; add a glue-based text
  block.
* New board restore mechanism based on `session$reload()`.
* Improvements to the registry: block icons and a fixed set of categories.

# blockr.core 0.1.0
